# Activecube: Multi-Dimensional Queries with Rails

Activecube is the library to make multi-dimensional queries to data warehouse, such as:

```sql

Cube.slice(
    date: cube.dimensions[:date][:date].format('%Y-%m'),
    currency: cube.dimensions[:currency][:symbol]
).measure(:count).
when(cube.selectors[:currency].in('USD','EUR').to_sql
```

Cube, dimensions, metrics and selectors are defined in the Model, similary to
ActiveRecord.

Activecube uses Rails ActiveRecord in implementation. 

In particular, you have to define all tables, used in
Activecube, as ActiveRecord tables.

 

## Installation
